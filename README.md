</div>

With the rapid advancement of Unreal Engine and the Python support in Unreal
Engine, more and more people are jumping into Unreal Python scripting. 
Hence the creation of this tool!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The tool needs the following library to be installed:

- Qt for Python: [PySide2](https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/) or [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)

- Python shim for all Qt bindings: [Qt.py](https://pypi.org/project/Qt.py/)


### Add as Menu Button

The tool is meant to be launched from a menu bar button like such:

<div align="center">

</div>

You can set up this very easily by adding `startup.py` as a startup script,
under _Project Settings - Plugins - Python_

- download the project zip file where you can find the `startup.py`, add
that location to the startup scripts: 
e.g. _"C:\Downloads\unrealScriptEditor\startup.py"_

### Simple Launch Script

**If** you just want to launch the tool in Unreal's python console without adding it to menu,
or if you want to customize the location where the tool is being launched;
refer to the following command:

- the tool has to be in a path that Unreal will search for!

```python
from unrealScriptEditor import main
global editor
editor = main.show()
```
